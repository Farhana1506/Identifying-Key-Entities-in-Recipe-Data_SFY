# Identifying-Key-Entities-in-Recipe-Data_SFY
Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically extract and classify key entities—such as quantities, units, and ingredient names—from unstructured recipe text.
By accurately identifying these entities, the project aims to transform raw ingredient lists into structured data, enabling advanced applications like recipe search, nutrition tracking, and automated grocery list generation.
